          As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower,
          slower, and warmer in the late summer.Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. 
          The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the<strong> River of No Return</strong>  by the people 
          living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit 
          and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.

          Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are 
          also commonly sighted. 
          The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches
          in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.

                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed 
                    rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower,
                    slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children
                    who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.
