          I have always had a knack for solving problems and I feel like software engineering does that. 
          I feel satisfaction in helping people in various aspects of their life. I am here to help consumers , companies and organizations find solutions they need. 
          Software engineering is a collaborative career that offers continous learning opportunities.

          My goal is to create web development services and web pages that are not only visually apealing but also user friendly.
          Because I  love this area of specialization so much I also want to create and maintain websites. I also want to ensure that the technical aspects of a site such a performance and capacity run smoothly.I want to be responsible for creating content for a site.
          Even when I was a child, I have always loved learning new languages and new ways to use new tools to make the process of development better.
